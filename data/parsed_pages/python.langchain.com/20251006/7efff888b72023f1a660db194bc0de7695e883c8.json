In 2024 Nolan won an Academy Award for best director for Oppenheimer (2023), which was also named best picture. Nolan’s breakthrough came with the 2000 film Memento, a sleeper hit that he adapted from a short story written by his brother Jonathan Nolan. The film was a critical and popular success and garnered the Nolan brothers an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. Nolan’s highly anticipated Batman Begins (2005), starring Christian Bale, focuses on the superhero’s origins and features settings and a tone that are grimmer and more realistic than those of previous Batman films.
