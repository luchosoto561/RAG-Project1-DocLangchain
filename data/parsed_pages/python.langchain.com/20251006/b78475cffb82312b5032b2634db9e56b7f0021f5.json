Here are the main techniques:1. **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: This prompting technique encourages a model to \"think step by step,\" allowing it to utilize more computational resources during testing to decompose challenging tasks into simpler parts. CoT not only simplifies tasks but also provides insights into the model's reasoning process.2. **Simple Prompting**: This can involve straightforward queries like \"Steps for XYZ\" or \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\" to guide the model in identifying the necessary steps.3. **Task-specific Instructions**: Using specific prompts tailored to the task at hand, such as \"Write a story outline\" for creative writing, allows for more directed decomposition.4. **Human Inputs**: Involving human expertise can also aid in breaking down tasks effectively.### Common Extensions of Task Decomposition Methods1. **Tree of Thoughts**: This method extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It decomposes the problem into various thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, forming a tree structure. This can utilize search processes like breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to evaluate states through classifiers or majority voting.These extensions build on the basic principles of task decomposition, enhancing the depth and breadth of reasoning applied to complex tasks."
