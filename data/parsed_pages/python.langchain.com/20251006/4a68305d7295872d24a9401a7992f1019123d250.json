Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation‚Äôs top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer‚Äôs legacy of excellence. A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she‚Äôs been nominated, she‚Äôs received a broad range of support‚Äîfrom the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. We can do both. At our border, we‚Äôve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  We‚Äôve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  We‚Äôre putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. We‚Äôre securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders."
