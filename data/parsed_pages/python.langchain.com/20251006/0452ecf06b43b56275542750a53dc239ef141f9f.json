Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation‚Äôs top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer‚Äôs legacy of excellence.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Document 2:A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she‚Äôs been nominated, she‚Äôs received a broad range of support‚Äîfrom the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. We can do both. At our border, we‚Äôve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  We‚Äôve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  We‚Äôre putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. We‚Äôre securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Document 3:And for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let‚Äôs finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. While it often appears that we never agree, that isn‚Äôt true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. And soon, we‚Äôll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. So tonight I‚Äôm offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.  First, beat the opioid epidemic.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Document 4:Tonight, I‚Äôm announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.  That ends on my watch. Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. We‚Äôll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. Let‚Äôs pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.  Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. Let‚Äôs increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill‚Äîour First Lady who teaches full-time‚Äîcalls America‚Äôs best-kept secret: community colleges."
