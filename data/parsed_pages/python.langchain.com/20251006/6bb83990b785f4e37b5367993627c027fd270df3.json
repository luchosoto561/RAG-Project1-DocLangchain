Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.Component One: Planning#A complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.Task Decomposition#Chain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to ‚Äúthink step by step‚Äù to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model‚Äôs thinking process.Source: {'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/'}Content: Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m==================================Task Decomposition is the process of breaking down a complicated task into smaller, manageable steps. It often involves techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT), which encourages models to think step by step, enhancing performance on complex tasks.

This approach enhances model performance by allowing for more thorough reasoning and planning. Task decomposition can be accomplished through various means, including:1. Simple prompting (e.g., asking for steps to achieve a goal).2. Task-specific instructions (e.g., asking for a story outline).3. Human inputs to guide the decomposition process.### Common Extensions of Task Decomposition Methods:1. **Tree of Thoughts**: This extension builds on CoT by not only decomposing the problem into thought steps but also generating multiple thoughts at each step, creating a tree structure. The search process can employ breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), with each state evaluated by a classifier or through majority voting.These extensions aim to enhance reasoning capabilities and improve the effectiveness of task decomposition in various contexts."
