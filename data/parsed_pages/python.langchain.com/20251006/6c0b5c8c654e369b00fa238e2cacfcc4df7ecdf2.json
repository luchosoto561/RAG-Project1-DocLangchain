For example, suppose you have a prompt template that requires two variables, foo and baz. If you get the foo value early on in your chain, but the baz value later, it can be inconvenient to pass both variables all the way through the chain. Instead, you can partial the prompt template with the foo value, and then pass the partialed prompt template along and just use that. Below is an example of doing this:"

You can't hard code it in the prompt, and passing it along with the other input variables is inconvenient. In this case, it's handy to be able to partial the prompt with a function that always returns the current date."
