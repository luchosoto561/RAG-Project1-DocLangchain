If he failed to do this, he would have been killed along with all those people who were on board the spacecraft.\\n3rd, let's imagine that Neil Armstrong successfully landed his spacecraft on the moon and made it back to Earth safely. The next step was for him to be hailed as a hero by his people back home. It took years before Neil Armstrong became an American hero.\\n4th, let's take another step back. Let's imagine that Neil Armstrong wasn't hailed as a hero, and instead, he was just forgotten. This happened in the 1970s. Neil Armstrong wasn't recognized for his remarkable achievement on the moon until after he died.\\n5th, let's take another step back. Let's imagine that Neil Armstrong didn't die in the 1970s and instead, lived to be a hundred years old. This happened in 2036. In the year 2036, Neil Armstrong would have been a centenarian.\\nNow, let's think about the present. Neil Armstrong is still alive. He turned 95 years old on July 20th, 2018. If he were to die now, his achievement of becoming the first human being to set foot on the moon would remain an unforgettable moment in history.\\nI hope this helps you understand the significance and importance of Neil Armstrong's achievement on the moon!\""
